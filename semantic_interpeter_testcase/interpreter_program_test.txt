1. Create your first "Hello World" program by asking the user for its name, then displaying "Hello <name>!"
in the console.

Example Run:
Please enter your name: NeilDG
Hello NeilDG!

2. Create a program that will get as input from the user the base and the height of a
triangle. Compute the area of the triangle.

Example Run:
Enter base: 15
Enter height : 3
The area of the triangle is 22.5

3. Check if you can support simple conditional statements. Write a program that will display ‘IT’S COLD!’ 
if the given temperature is less than 20, ‘IT’S HOT!’ if the given temperature is greater than 30, ‘COOL
CLIMATE!’ otherwise.

Example Run:
Enter temperature: 21
COOL CLIMATE!

Enter temperature: 19
IT'S COLD!

4. Check if you can support conditional statements with simple arithmetic and logical expressions.
Write a program that will ask the user for the grades of their 3 assignments. The grade weight is as follows:

Assignment 1 - 40%
Assignment 2 - 35%
Assignment 3 - 25%

Afterwards, compute for the final grade and display its DLSU equivalent grade.

>= 94 --> 4.0
>= 89 --> 3.5
>= 83 --> 3.0
>= 78 --> 2.5
>=72  --> 2.0
>= 66 --> 1.5
>= 60 --> 1.0
below 60 --> 0.0


Example Run: 
Enter assignment 1 grade: 90
Enter assignment 2 grade: 50
Enter assignment 3 grade: 75

Your grade is: 72.25. Your DLSU grade is: 2.0.

5. Check if you can support simple loops. Write a program that will continuously ask the user for a number.
If the user enters a negative number, the program halts and then displays the total of all numbers entered (except
the negative number).

Example Run:
Gimme number: 1
Gimme number: 2
Gimme number: 3
Gimme number: 4
Gimme number: 5
Gimme number: 6
Gimme number: 7
Gimme number: 8
Gimme number: -1

Total: 36
